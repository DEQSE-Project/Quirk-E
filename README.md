# Quirk-E
Quirk-E is an extension of the Quirk [1]. Quirk-E has been developed as part of the DEQSE project at the University of Jyväskylä, Finland. 

The Quirk-E tool, which has been presented in [2] (https://doi.org/), adds more functionalities to the Quirk [1] quantum circuit simulator.

The Quirk-E is free to use and modify. However, you must add reference #[2] in case of any publication.

This work has been supported by the Academy of Finland (project DEQSE 349945).
